## Welcome to the Homepage of the SECPPS Worksjop Series (Website under development)

Software is playing an increasingly important role in assuring effective and efficient operation of industrial automation engineering systems. However software engineering methods applied in this field lag behind the conventional software engineering methods, where tremendous progress has been made in the last years.

The aim of this workshop is to discuss new approaches and methods for the design of software for use in the production systems domain, which follows the latest trends from the software engineering domain. Additionally, the workshop will address the challenges in adopting state-of-the-art software engineering tools and techniques to the automation domain and discuss various approaches to tackle the issues.
