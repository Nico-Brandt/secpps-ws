## Welcome to the Homepage of the SECPPS Workshop Series

Software is playing an increasingly important role in assuring effective and efficient operation of industrial automation engineering systems. However, software engineering methods applied in this field lag behind the conventional software engineering methods, where tremendous progress has been made in the last years.

The workshop on Software Engineering in Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS) aims to discuss new approaches and methods for the design of software for use in the production systems domain, which follows the latest trends from the software engineering domain. Additionally, the workshop will address the challenges in adopting state-of-the-art software engineering tools and techniques to the automation domain and discuss various approaches to tackle the issues. Particularly, we are currently facing a dramatically increasing complexity in the development and operation of systems with the emergence of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). This demands for more comprehensive and systematic views on all aspects of systems (e.g., mechanics, electronics, software, and network) not only in the engineering process, but in the operation process as well. Moreover, flexible approaches are needed to adapt the systems’ behavior to ever-changing requirements and tasks, unexpected conditions, as well as structural transformations.

## SECPPS 2021 (Feb 22, 2021)

The 2021 Edition of this Workshop series -- it's first instance -- will be collocated with the <a href="https://se-2021.tu-bs.de/"><b>Software Engineering (SE21)</b></a> conference, to be held from Feb 22-26, 2021, organized in a virtual format by TU Braunschweig, Germany.

The workshop will take place on <b>February 22, 2021</b>, 09:00-17:00 CET (with enough breaks).

We aim for an interactive format to stimulate group discussions which potentially lead to further activities such as joint publications, projects, and networks.

To reach this goal, we plan to invite two keynote speakers: one from the SE community as well as one from the CPPS community to enlighten the audience with concrete experiences and thoughts from both fields in order to set the stage. 

These keynotes will be followed by an introduction and discussion round in which each workshop participant introduces his-/herself and clarifies his/her expectations for the workshop and maybe a provocative statement and/or challenges for SE in CPPS. This will be collected (live), on a shared whiteboard, to be potentially discussed in break-out groups. 

The collected statements will be clustered and the participants can then vote for topics to be discussed in break-out groups in the afternoon. 

The results of the break-out groups will be presented (by the break-out group leaders) and discussed in the large audience to come up with a collaborative research roadmap and networks to identify potential collaborations.

For the lightning talks and the discussions we foresee the following initial list of topics:

<ul>
  <li>Engineering Process (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, ...)</li>
  <li>Operation and Evolution (Data-driven, continuous integration, DevOps, agile, ...)</li>
  <li>Languages (DSLs, GPLs, standards, ...)</li>
  <li>Modeling (MDD, MDE, Transformations, Interoperability, Code generation ...)</li>
  <li>Teaching (how to train SE in other disciplines, open courseware, ...)</li>
  <li>Management (Variability, modularization, configuration, ... )</li>
  <li>Usability and SE Tools (adoption, user interactions, ...)</li>
  <li>Emerging technologies (Cloud, AI, IoT, ...)</li>
  <li>Intelligent organization (Multi-agent systems, flexible architectures, ...)</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary collaboration (Interfaces, conflict management, optimization, ...)</li>
</ul>

The workshop will be concluded with setting up a collaborative space to document the results and help with future activities of the workshop.

# Virtual Format

For holding the workshop virtually, we plan to use Zoom or WebEx to live-stream all presentations and enable discussions and break-out groups. We will additionally rely on a shared online whiteboard (e.g., Miro) to support discussions and creative processes. Stay tuned for further information.

# Registration

SECPPS 2021 is collocated with the <a href="https://se-2021.tu-bs.de/"><b>Software Engineering (SE21)</b></a> conference, to be held from Feb 22-26, 2021, organized in a virtual format by TU Braunschweig, Germany.

Please use the <a href="https://se-2021.tu-bs.de/registrierung/">registration system of SE21</a> to register for the workshop. Participation in the workshop itself is free as is participation in SE21 (if you have no paper). If you have a paper at SE21 or another workshop, you have to pay for this paper, of course.

# Keynotes

<b>Keynote 1 <a href="https://www.mw.tum.de/ais/lehrstuhl/personen/prof-vogel-heuser/">Prof. Birgit Vogel-Heuser</a></b> Forever Young Automated Production Systems

Wie können sich automatisierte Produktionssysteme selbst anpassen bzw. wie kann die Systemevolution solcher Systeme gemanagt werden? Die Systemevolution von automatisierte Produktionssysteme, kurz aPS, ist in aller Munde unter dem Stichwort Industrie 4.0 oder Cyber Physical Production Systems. Neben den gekoppelten System- und Softwaremodellen auf denen solche Anpassungen basieren, werden Agentenansätze vorgestellt, die die Rekonfiguration auf verschiedenen Ebenen der aPS erlauben. Ein Schwerpunkt wird auf Modularität und Variabilität als Voraussetzung solcher Systeme gelegt und auf Refactoring-Ansätze, um zu dieser zu gelangen.

<b>Keynote 2 <a href="http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/cms/staff/jarke">Prof. Matthias Jarke</a> und <a href="http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/cms/staff/koren">Dr. Istvan Koren<a></b> Synthesizing Software Engineering Perspectives on CPPS: The Case of the Internet of Production

Abstract to be added

# Call/Publication of Results

We do <b>not</b> call for scientific papers but rather are inviting specific people from the community, which will be asked to give provocative opening statements. As a result of the workshop, we want to summarize the key findings (open challenges of SE in CPPS/research roadmap) as a technical report and a subset of this report is planned to be published via a general scientific computer science/software engineering magazine or journal. We will invite workshop participants to co-author this report.
