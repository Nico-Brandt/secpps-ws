## Welcome to the Homepage of the SECPPS Workshop Series

Software is playing an increasingly important role in assuring effective and efficient operation of industrial automation engineering systems. However, software engineering methods applied in this field lag behind the conventional software engineering methods, where tremendous progress has been made in the last years.

The workshop on Software Engineering in Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS) aims to discuss new approaches and methods for the design of software for use in the production systems domain, which follows the latest trends from the software engineering domain. Additionally, the workshop will address the challenges in adopting state-of-the-art software engineering tools and techniques to the automation domain and discuss various approaches to tackle the issues. Particularly, we are currently facing a dramatically increasing complexity in the development and operation of systems with the emergence of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). This demands for more comprehensive and systematic views on all aspects of systems (e.g., mechanics, electronics, software, and network) not only in the engineering process, but in the operation process as well. Moreover, flexible approaches are needed to adapt the systems’ behavior to ever-changing requirements and tasks, unexpected conditions, as well as structural transformations.

## Collaborative Space/Results

We have set up a Google Drive Folder in which we collected the results of the workshops (notes, drawings, presentations). We also have set up a Github repository to collect reading material (SECPPS Body of Knowledge). Access to both is restricted. Please join our initiative to get access, e.g., be registering for and participating in one of the next editions of our workshop series (see below) or by contacting the organizers.

# SECPPS 2022/1 (Feb 21, 2022)

The 2022 Edition of this Workshop series -- it's second instance collocated to SE and the overall fourth instance -- will be collocated with the <a href="https://www.se-2022.de/"><b>Software Engineering (SE22)</b></a> conference, to be held from Feb 21-25, 2022, organized in a virtual format by the Humboldt-University Berlin.

The workshop will take place on <b>February 21, 2022</b>, 09:00-17:00 CET.

We aim for an interactive format to stimulate group discussions which potentially lead to further activities, such as joint publications, projects, and networks.  

To reach this goal, we plan to invite two keynote speakers: one from the SE community and one from the CPPS community to enlighten the audience with concrete experiences and thoughts from both fields in order to set the stage. 

After the keynotes, we will have project showcases demonstrating applications of and technologies for SECPPS, for which we will invite industrial, semi-industrial (e.g., Fraunhofer), and academic (such as from the Internet of Production excellence cluster) researchers and engineers.

These presentations will be followed by brief lightning talks (invited, about 5 minutes) as well as presentations of results of the earlier SECPPS workshops. After each talk, questions, challenges, and statements will be collected to be potentially discussed in break-out groups in the afternoon.  

For the lightning talks and the discussions we foresee the following initial list of topics:

<ul>
  <li>Engineering Process (Requirements, design, implementation, verification & validation, ...)</li>
  <li>Operation and Evolution (Data-driven, continuous integration, DevOps, digital twins, agile, ...)</li>
  <li>Languages (DSLs, GPLs, standards, ...)</li>
  <li>Modeling (MDD, MDE, transformations, interoperability, code generation ...)</li>
  <li>Security and Safety (CPPS-specific safety/security protection objectives, security analysis, ...)</li>
  <li>Teaching (how to train SE in other disciplines, open courseware, ...)</li>
  <li>Management (Variability, modularization, configuration, ... )</li>
  <li>Usability and SE Tools (adoption, user interactions, ...)</li>
  <li>Emerging technologies (Cloud, AI, IoT, ...)</li>
  <li>Intelligent organization (Multi-agent systems, flexible architectures, ...)</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary collaboration (Interfaces, conflict management, optimization, ...)</li>
</ul>

We will document the results of the workshop in a collaborative space to guide future activities of the community already partly built by the previous edition of the workshop. 

# Virtual Format

For holding the workshop virtually, we plan to use a video conferencing system such as Zoom to live-stream all presentations and enable discussions and break-out groups. We will additionally use shared online whiteboards and drawing tools to support discussions and creative processes.

# Keynotes

<b><a href="https://www.isw.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Verl/">Prof. Alexander Verl</a>: Quo vadis Produktionsautomatisierung?</b>

Software treibt unsere Fähigkeiten der Produktionsautomatisierung. Durch neue Softwaremethoden für Digitale Zwillinge basierend auf Echtzeitsimulation und die Anwendung künstlicher Intelligenz in der Produktionsautomatisierung ermöglicht und begünstigt sie neue Produktionsmethoden, neue Anwendungen in der Industrierobotik und sogar neuartige Geschäftsmodelle in der Werkzeugmaschinenindustrie. Dieser Vortrag beleuchtet Forschungs- und Entwicklungstrends in der Produktionsautomatisierung aus dem Blickwinkel eines Steuerungstechnikers.

<b><a href="https://dsis.kastel.kit.edu/staff_ralf_reussner.php">Prof. Ralf Reussner</a>: Multi-Model Development of CPS: Can Software Engineering Methods help?</b>

The term software Engineering often refers to the transfer of engineering methods to the construction of software. Model based simulation, lean production are among the techniques inspired by electrical and mechanical engineering. However, through the increased role of software in basically all engineering artifacts and due to the advancement of software engineering methods, one could ask whether software engineering also has some methods to export to, for example, systems engineering? In this talk we try to give answers to these questions and illustrate it with research challenges from the field of multi-model development in vehicle engineering.

# Publication of Results

We do not call for scientific papers but rather are looking for lightning talks and project showcases by participants, which they will have to propose before the workshop. 

As a result of the workshop, we want to summarize the key findings as a technical report and a subset of this report is planned to be published via a relevant conference or journal.

Moreover, we will invite the participants to join the ongoing work of the SECPPS community which started with SECPPS'21 and continues until today.

# SECPPS 2021/3 (October 1, 2021)

On October 1, 2021, we held another SECPPS workshop. For this instance, we invited speakers from industry to share their work and challenges wrt Software Engineering in Cyber-Physical Production Systems. We learned about lean-digital-transformation for engineering, DevOps for cyber-physical systems of systems, cyber-physical production system concepts in research and reality, challenges regarding variants and their compatibility, CPPS software architectures, challenges in production automation systems development, tools for CPPS engineering, and quality assurance for CPPS. We also had short reports from our working groups and a discussion about next steps/events (see above).

# SECPPS 2021/2 (April 27, 2021)

On April 27, 2021, the participants of SECPPS 2021 at SE21 met again, virtually to further discuss the results of the break-out groups and form working groups. As a result, we formed the following working groups (if you are interested to join, please contact the group leaders indicated below):

<ul>
  <li>Modeling, Variability and Standardization (Andreas Wortmann, Uni Stuttgart and Manuel Wimmer, JKU Linz)</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinarity (Birgit Vogel-Heuser, TU Munich)</li>
  <li>Case Studies and Demonstrators (Alois Zoitl, JKU Linz)</li>
  <li>Digital Twins, AI and Development Processes (Christian Sauer, Uni Hildesheim)</li>
</ul>

# SECPPS 2021 (Feb 22, 2021)

The 2021 Edition of this Workshop series -- it's first instance -- was collocated with the Software Engineering (SE21) conference, held from Feb 22-26, 2021, organized in a virtual format by TU Braunschweig, Germany.

The workshop took place on February 22, 2021, 09:00-17:00 CET.

We aimed for an interactive format to stimulate group discussions which potentially lead to further activities such as joint publications, projects, and networks.

To reach this goal, we invited two keynote speakers: one from the SE community as well as one from the CPPS community to enlighten the audience with concrete experiences and thoughts from both fields in order to set the stage. 

These keynotes were followed by an introduction and discussion round in which each workshop participant introduced his-/herself and clarified his/her expectations for the workshop. This was collected (live), on a shared whiteboard, to be potentially discussed in break-out groups. 

The collected statements were clustered and the participants then voted for topics to be discussed in break-out groups in the afternoon. 

The results of the break-out groups were presented (by the break-out group leaders) and discussed in the large audience to come up with a collaborative research roadmap and networks to identify potential collaborations.

For the lightning talks and the discussions we used the following list of topics:

<ul>
  <li>Engineering Process (Requirements, design, implementation, testing, ...)</li>
  <li>Operation and Evolution (Data-driven, continuous integration, DevOps, agile, ...)</li>
  <li>Languages (DSLs, GPLs, standards, ...)</li>
  <li>Modeling (MDD, MDE, transformations, interoperability, code generation ...)</li>
  <li>Security and Safety (CPPS-specific safety/security protection objectives, security analysis, ...)</li>
  <li>Teaching (how to train SE in other disciplines, open courseware, ...)</li>
  <li>Management (Variability, modularization, configuration, ... )</li>
  <li>Usability and SE Tools (adoption, user interactions, ...)</li>
  <li>Emerging technologies (Cloud, AI, IoT, ...)</li>
  <li>Intelligent organization (Multi-agent systems, flexible architectures, ...)</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary collaboration (Interfaces, conflict management, optimization, ...)</li>
</ul>

The workshop concluded with setting up a collaborative space to document the results and help with future activities of the workshop.

# Keynotes

<b>Keynote 1 <a href="https://www.mw.tum.de/ais/lehrstuhl/personen/prof-vogel-heuser/">Prof. Birgit Vogel-Heuser</a></b> Forever Young Automated Production Systems

Wie können sich automatisierte Produktionssysteme selbst anpassen bzw. wie kann die Systemevolution solcher Systeme gemanagt werden? Die Systemevolution von automatisierte Produktionssysteme, kurz aPS, ist in aller Munde unter dem Stichwort Industrie 4.0 oder Cyber Physical Production Systems. Neben den gekoppelten System- und Softwaremodellen auf denen solche Anpassungen basieren, werden Agentenansätze vorgestellt, die die Rekonfiguration auf verschiedenen Ebenen der aPS erlauben. Ein Schwerpunkt wird auf Modularität und Variabilität als Voraussetzung solcher Systeme gelegt und auf Refactoring-Ansätze, um zu dieser zu gelangen.

<b>Keynote 2 <a href="http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/cms/staff/jarke">Prof. Matthias Jarke</a> und <a href="http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/cms/staff/koren">Dr. Istvan Koren</a></b> Synthesizing Software Engineering Perspectives on CPPS: The Case of the Internet of Production

Als CPPS-orientierte Fokussierung des Internet der Dinge verbindet das Internet der Produktion (IoP) bisher isolierte Datenquellen aus cyberphysischen Produktionssystemen und Informationssystemen der beteiligten Stakeholder mit dem Ziel effektiverer Innovation durch weltweite Verzahnung von Produktentwicklung, Produktionsbetrieb und Produktnutzung. Software-Engineering-Ansätze werden dabei mit Aspekten des Datenmanagements und maschinellen Lernens sowie auch der Kommunikationstechnik verzahnt. Um die Komplexität zu managen, setzen wir einerseits auf das Konzept des Digitalen Schattens als anwendungsbezogene Datenabstraktion, anderseits unterstützt unsere DevOpsUse-Methodik durch die kontinuierliche Einbeziehung der Endnutzer Nachhaltigkeit im Entwicklungsprozess.
