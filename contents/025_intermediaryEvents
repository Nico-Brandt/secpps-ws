We learned about lean-digital-transformation for engineering, DevOps for cyber-physical systems of systems, cyber-physical production system concepts in research and reality, challenges regarding variants and their compatibility, CPPS software architectures, challenges in production automation systems development, tools for CPPS engineering, and quality assurance for CPPS. We also had short reports from our working groups and a discussion about next steps/events (see above).
