# 6th Workshop on Software Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS)


## About 
Software plays an essential part in the efficient operation of modern production systems. While variability and complexity represent key challenges for cyber-physical production systems,  software design in production systems is still a neglected topic. The SECPPS workshop series aims to promote modern software engineering solutions to the challenges of cyber-physical production systems and foster interdisciplinary discussion.

This workshop edition is co-located with [SE 2024](https://se2024.se.jku.at/).

## Call for Papers
For the first time in the workshop series, we are pleased to invite submissions of *short papers* on contributions that address the challenges of CPPS. Additionally, the workshop offers the opportunity to present ideas or problem statements in *lightning talks* and to discuss current topics in groups.

**Your submission may address one of the following topics:**

<ul>
  <li>Engineering Process (Requirements, design, implementation, verification & validation, ...)</li>
  <li>Operation and Evolution (Data-driven, continuous integration, DevOps, digital twins, agile, ...)</li>
  <li>Languages (DSLs, GPLs, standards, ...)</li>
  <li>Modeling (MDD, MDE, transformations, interoperability, code generation ...)</li>
  <li>Security and Safety (CPPS-specific safety/security protection objectives, security analysis, ...)</li>
  <li>Teaching (how to train SE in other disciplines, open courseware, ...)</li>
  <li>Management (Variability, modularization, configuration, ... )</li>
  <li>Usability and SE Tools (adoption, user interactions, ...)</li>
  <li>Emerging technologies (Cloud, AI, IoT, ...)</li>
  <li>Intelligent organization (Multi-agent systems, flexible architectures, ...)</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary collaboration (Interfaces, conflict management, optimization, ...)</li>
</ul>

### Submission Information:
  
  * **Short Papers** may be written in German or English and can be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=secpps2024). They should be of 6-12 pages single-column [LNI format](https://github.com/gi-ev/LNI) and need to include the [GI license terms](https://confluence.gi.de/display/GIDOCS/Nutzungslizenzen).

  * **Lightning Talks** We expect a title and short abstract (max. 2 pages) sent via email to the organizers directly.

  *Short papers* undergo a peer-reviewing process and accepted papers will be published in the SE workshop proceedings and will be available in the [GI digital library](dl.gi.de). Note, that at least one author needs to register for the conference. 
  
  Abstracts for *lightning talks* will not be published and will undergo a light-weight review process by the organizers.

### Important Dates:
